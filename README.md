1.I was motivated creating this weather board and it was our first project that used Apis. Being able to link Apis and see a website you create update accurately to the worls around you is so rewarding as it showcases real time data

2.This project was built to display the weather anywhere in the world. Being able to access weather from anywhere around the world at anytime is beneficial when planning out activities throughout the week, event planning, when to do laundry or even when a good time to plan a holiday is. weather apps provide us with this data we are able to associate with everyday activities throughout our lives.

3.Weather is important throughout our lives in many different ways. All living organisms on earth depend on the weather and require liquid water for survival. Having a working weather board provides us with guidance in what to prepare for within the upcoming weeks weather its drought, rain , storm or sun people aren't left blindsided when a weather board is accessible to them.

4.Throughout this assignment the biggest thing I learned was how to incorporate the skills I've learnt in class and apply it to my assignment. Implementing what we learned throughout the week in class on how to apply data through API'S really put the assignment together in the end as it activates the system and updates the board.

5.I believe my weather board is set to stand out due to the clear simple display it contains, its not over done and confusing, it potrays the weater accurately and clear . yet, i have benefitialy used css to draw attention to important sections on the page that need to stand out and be seen. Everything is put in a specific place spaced out and eye catching colours.
